vLLM-omni: Multi-modality models inference and serving with
non-autoregressive structures.

This package extends vLLM beyond traditional text-based, autoregressive
generation to support multi-modality models with non-autoregressive
structures and non-textual outputs.

Architecture:
- 🟡 Modified: vLLM components modified for multimodal support
- 🔴 Added: New components for multimodal and non-autoregressive
  processing
